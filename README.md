Here’s a clear, beginner-friendly `README.md` for your RAG project, designed to explain what it does, how it works, and how someone can run it from scratch.

# 🧠 RAG-Food: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Demo (Python + Next.js)

This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** demo for food-related questions, using:

- ✅ Python backend (FastAPI)
- ✅ Next.js frontend (React)
- ✅ [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com/) for embeddings (`mxbai-embed-large-v1`)
- ✅ [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) as the vector database
- ✅ [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for local LLM (e.g. `llama3.2`)
- ✅ A simple food dataset in JSON

---

## 🎯 What This Does

- Lets you ask questions like:
  - “Which Indian dish uses chickpeas?”
  - “What dessert is made from milk and soaked in syrup?”
  - “What is masala dosa made of?”
- Answers are **grounded in your own food data**, not just LLM memory.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+
- Ollama (running locally)
- Clarifai account (for API key)
- ChromaDB (Python package)

---

## 🚀 Setup & Running

### 1. **Clone this repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruchingale/RagFood-AI-.git
cd RagFood-AI-
```

### 2. **Install Python dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Clarifai API key:

```
CLARIFAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 4. **Run the app**

#### Backend (Python)

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

#### Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now, you can access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Data** is loaded from the JSON file
2. Each entry is embedded using Clarifai's `mxbai-embed-large-v1`
3. Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB
4. When you ask a question:

   - The question is embedded
   - The top 1–2 most relevant chunks are retrieved
   - The context + question is passed to the local LLM via Ollama
   - The model answers using that info only

---

## 🔍 Try Custom Questions

You can update the frontend code to include your own questions like:

```javascript
const response = await fetch("/api/query", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ question: "What is tandoori chicken?" }),
});
```

---

## 🚀 Next Ideas

- Swap in larger datasets (Wikipedia articles, recipes, PDFs)
- Add more advanced search and filtering options
- Improve UI/UX with better design and user feedback
- Deploy the app on a cloud platform (e.g. Heroku, Vercel)
